# TCR2HLAi

We built a web app using our pre-trained TCR2HLA models with [Marimo](https://marimo.io), a reactive Python notebook framework for interactive applications. Drag and drop your human TCR𝛃 repertoire repertoires as a single .zip file to estimate the probability of common HLA genotypes on a serverless web application, where your data stays on your web browser!
