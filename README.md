# TCR2HLAi

## Want to try TCR2HLA?

To help, we built a serverless web app [TCR2HLAi](https://kmayerb.github.io/TCR2HLAi/) with Marimo that runs our pre-trained TCR2HLA models directly in your browser. Simply drag and drop a `.zip` file of human TCRβ repertoires to estimate common HLA genotype probabilities—your data never leaves your device. 

To facilitate ease of use, no installation or login is required.

For the full Python package—enabling parallelization across multiple CPUs and discovery of new HLA-associated TCRs and TCR metaclonotypes—please visit [github.com/kmayerb/TCR2HLA](https://github.com/kmayerb/TCR2HLA).

[Marimo](https://marimo.io) is a reactive Python notebook framework for interactive applications.
